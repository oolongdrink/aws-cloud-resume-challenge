# Overview
This is a Cloud Resume Challenge project. WIP...

## Challenge Requirements
* The resume must be written in HTML and styled with CSS.
* Deployed online as a static S3 Amazon website.
* Use HTTPS for security.
* Register a DNS name and point it to the CloudFront distribution.
* Add a visitor counter using JavaScript.
* Amazon DynamoDB can be used to store visitor metrics.
* Use Lambda or AWS's API gateway to enable comms between the visitor DB and the web app sending visitor metrics.
* Write Lambda functions in Python.
* Test your Python code.
* Define the DynamoDB table, Lambda function, and anything via AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template and deploy them using AWS SAM CLI.
* Use GitHub to make updates to the back-end API and front end website.
* Setup GitHub Actions to run test against changes.
* Create a second Github repo for the website code. Configure it so the S3 bucket picks up changes automatically.
